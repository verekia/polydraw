# polydraw

- export options:

  - Normalized with IDs or pre-joined with duplicate points

- number inputs still behave weird sometimes, cannot type point

There is a bug when subdividing a segment that creates a point in an other polygon, and that point is last. It adds it in second position instead of first or last.
